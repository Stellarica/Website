/*
KEEP THIS

There is a main file on github

It can be found at 
https://github.com/sparkles3421/stellarica-website/blob/main/main.js
or
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkles3421/stellarica-website/main/main.js
(which is called)

Currently the file will not do anything.
As the website is alright.

This means that I can edit it easily without any pulls.
I did this as if I changed the JSON it could break 
everything because the js file was still looking
in the old directory.

I would recommend you keep this file
incase you forget.

When the file loads you may get a
Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB) blocked cross-origin response
warning.

if you have any questions about the
code or website, ask about them!
ether add a issue or message me
on discord(sparkles3421#3970).
